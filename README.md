# Compsc487WRefactor
Refactor and CI Assignment
Select one of the two assignments from above. They are both completed homework assignments from CS132. Inside of each of these files are many asserts which can be thought of as test cases. There are also many sample codes which verify that the classes written are correct.

You need to refactor these assignments into useful Python packages. 

The steps for this include: 

create a GitHub repo (public or private -- add wagenhoffer to the repo)
establish a "build" system - Poetry, setuptools, etc.
refactor the code into src files and test files
ensure the code passes tests using Pytest, PyUnit, or Doctest
run a linter over the code using Flake8, Black, Pylama etc
run a coverage report 
Setup a Continuous Integration that runs the tests, linter, and coverage on the code on a push.
submit the link to your repo for a grade
If you hate the Python assignments, I will gladly provide Racket or Julia codes for you to do the same operations on.
